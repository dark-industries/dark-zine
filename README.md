## born of dark slack

## a few ideas

- "I think meme ecosystems is definitely a top contendor for a theme."
- "i was gonna do a write-up of all the social simulation models i've been researching"
- "I have a bunch of thoughts on internet image ecosystems already >:)"
- "I've got something brewing in my brain about repo/version control for use in design/educational/radical contexts"
- "I have a couple stuff on contrast (contrasting flavors / contrasting opinions / contrasting personal beliefs / etc) and I'm trying to formulate sane thoughts around "to actually contribute towards making society better you might need to first shatter your reality""
- "i want to write about philosophy and video games"

## next steps

- start writing
- keep sharing ideas
- think about what the goal is
- enjoy memes

## where else are we
