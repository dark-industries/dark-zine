# A Dark Slack General Theory of Apology

Need to make an apology? OK, buddy, let’s figure out how to tackle this. 

0. Figure out if the other party actually needs to hear it. If so…
1. Say “I am sorry.”
2. Explain what it is you did wrong. 
3. Show that it won’t happen again, and that you have learned. 


Remember: don’t do it for yourself. Do it because they need it too. Don’t expect anything in return. 

Now get on with your life fam.
