# design intervention


2am.

Erica closed all her tabs and shut her eyes. She took a deep breath and exhaled. Her body loosened up and she noticed the sharp, tinny taste of kale salad resting on her tongue. She tried to swallow it, but that only increased the flavor. The chime of her neighbor's piano played in the background.

She opened her eyes and clicked on an orange diamond icon. An instant jolt of excitement lit up her eyes. She scrolled through the fonts and picked a font called:

> Neue Haas Unica! Haven’t used this one before! Finally, I can put that $400 to good use.

Erica spent the next 2.5 hours examining and playing with this font. She setting a comfortable line-length, never extending beyond 75 characters. Fixed the spacing between individual characters on larger font sizes. She had done this task multiple times, but it felt cathartic every time. It was one of the few skills she felt proud of to put on her resume.

3:43am.

> Erica: Fuck, it's Sunday?! I'm definitely going to be late tomorrow. 9AM is wayyy too early for people to be working.

Erica was not late to work the next day.As Erica approaches the door, she notices how awkwardly silent the office was.

> Erica(smiling): Ha, and here I thought I was going to be late for work.

She got her side project done and got to work on time. "That was a productive weekend", she thought.

When she entered the office, familiar faces were sitting in a circle. All eyes locked on to her as the door slammed shut.

> Erica: "Umm, what's going on? I don't remember the stand-up being moved to 10. And why is Tobin here?"

Tobin, Larry, and Benn were all sitting on a mid-century sofa. An Eames Lounge chair swiveled around to reveal a slightly older gentleman.

> Bill: "Erica, we decided to cancel work today for something urgent."
>
Erica was confused. " Are we getting acquired?", she wondered.
>
> Benn: "I just want to note that Brian and Larry went through the same thing. So, you're not alone in this."
>
>Erica:"What? I have no idea what you're talking about"
>
>Bill: "We're very sorry that's it come to this, but we all feel like this has become a serious problem. We just want to be transparent about it. Benn, do you want to go first?"

>Benn: "Last week, at our happy hour, you were so excited about this civic hackathon you were planning. You asked us to join, but we declined. After that you texted all of us "Come to my hackathon, if you want to do impactful work :)"

We all work together, Erica! What do you mean "impactful work?!?!"

> Erica: You're overreacting, it was just one text.
>
> Benn: "Okay how about those condescending scoffs when I talk about any of my hobbies. You're like on this high horse thinking-"
>
> Erica: Dude, IPAs are not a hobby.

> Benn: Oh my god, I--

> Bill "Okay you two, just calm down. Remember Benn, this intervention is about Erica's problems. Let's try to think about how we can help her."

> Erica: By bringing my fucking ex?! In what way are you “helping me”?!
>
> Tobin: Hi Erica, it’s okay. We made it to Series B. Turns out underestimated my ability to handle the design work. Your styleguide was super helpful though.
>
> Erica: What?! Ex-boyfriend, not ex-coworker, you dumb shit.
>
> Tobin: Oh...

> Larry: "I'm just going to be blunt. Erica, you subscribe to this idea that design is this world-changing profession, but have you looked outside of your circle? Are you familiar with the frog in the well story? A frog in a well can't solve problems that she doesn't experience."

> Erica: "Oh wow. Okay.. damn, a frog in a well, Larry? Are you practicing for a lightning-demo? I hope everyone throws their expensive lattes at you.

> Larry: "Come again?"

> In a flash, Larry was lying on the edge of the sofa.

> Bill: "ERICA! Larry, are you okay?!"

> Erica: "I quit."

> Bill: "No you're fired. Please sign these papers."

> Erica: "You prepared to fire me?"

> Bill: "No, I prepared that you would leave politely, like a civil human being"

> Erica: "Whatever. Screw all of you and your trivial company."
