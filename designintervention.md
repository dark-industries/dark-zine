INT. ERICA'S APARTMENT - MIDNIGHT

Erica closed all her tabs and shut her eyes. She took a deep breath and exhaled. Her body loosened up and she noticed the sharp, tinny taste of kale salad resting on her tongue. She tried to swallow it, but that only increased the flavor. The chime of her neighbor's piano played in the background.

She opened her eyes and clicked on an orange diamond icon. An instant jolt of excitement lit up her eyes. She scrolled through the fonts and landed on one.

ERICA

Neue Haas Unica! Haven’t used this one before! Finally, I can put that $400 to good use."

Erica spent the next 2.5 hours examining and playing with this font. She setting a comfortable line-length, never extending beyond 75 characters. Fixed the spacing between individual characters on larger font sizes. She had done this task multiple times, but it felt cathartic every time. It was one of the few skills she felt proud of to put on her resume.



ERICA

Fuck, it's Sunday?! I'm definitely going to be late tomorrow. 9AM is wayyy too early for people to be working.


EXT. MARKET ST AND 4TH - MORNING

ERICA
Ha, and here I thought I was going to be late for work.

*(I started my side project and got to work on time)*

INT. STARTUP OFFICE

Erica enters the office.Familiar faces were sitting in a circle. All eyes locked on to her as the door slammed shut.

ERICA
Umm, what's going on? I don't remember the stand-up being moved to 10. And why is Tobin here?

Tobin, Larry, and Benn were all sitting on a mid-century sofa. An Eames Lounge chair swiveled around to reveal a slightly older gentleman.

BILL
Erica, we decided to cancel work today for something urgent."

*("Are we getting acquired?", Erica wondered)*

BENN

I just want to note that Brian and Larry went through the same thing. So, you're not alone in this.

ERICA

I have no idea what you're talking about.


BILL

I'm deeply saddened that's it come to this, but we all feel like this has become a serious problem. We just want to be transparent about it. Benn, do you want to go first?


BENN

Last week, at our happy hour, you were so excited about this civic hackathon you were planning. You asked us to join, but we declined. After that you texted all of us:

>"Come to my hackathon, if you want to do impactful work :)"

We all work together, Erica! What do you mean "impactful work?!?!"

ERICA
You're overreacting, it was just one text.

BENN
Okay how about those condescending scoffs when I talk about any of my hobbies. You're like on this high horse thinking-"


ERICA

Dude, IPAs are not a hobby.

BENN

Oh my god, I--

BILL

Okay you two, just calm down. Remember Benn, this intervention is about Erica's problems. Let's try to think about how we can help her.

ERICA

You say it like you actually care about me.

BILL

I do.

ERICA

Then why the hell did you bring Tobin to this?! We're not even together anymore.

BILL

Well you used to be coworkers, so I thought you two were pretty close.

TOBIN

Hi Erica, it’s okay. We made it to Series B. Turns out I underestimated my ability. Your styleguide was super rad though.

ERICA

///still working on this///

LARRY

I'm just going to be blunt. Erica, you subscribe to this idea that design is this world-changing profession, but have you looked outside of your circle? Are you familiar with the frog in the well story? A frog in a well can't solve problems that she doesn't experience.

ERICA

Holy shit, how long did you practice that in the mirror?

LARRY

Larry smirks.

Is it good? I have a talk I'm giving next week about empathy in design--

ERICA jumps out of her seat and punches LARRY in the face. LARRY holds his face on the edge of the sofa.

BILL

ERICA!!! Oh my god,Larry, are you okay?

ERICA

I quit Bill.

BILL
No I'm firing you. I already prepared your papers.

ERICA

You prepared to fire me?

BILL

No, I prepared that you would leave politely, like a civil human being

ERICA
Whatever. Blow it out your ass.
