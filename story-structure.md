1. Erica spends all her evenings working on side projects. These all deal with the theme of making the world a better place. She loves what she does and she finds her goals attainable. People praise her for her ambition. She works at a SaaS company and her motto has changed to separate life from work. She makes the money so she can work on her own projects.
3. Her friends and coworkers confront her through an "you think design is changing the world" intervention. Erica also did not know that these interventions are common. These two truths cause her to have a self-identity crisis.
4. But because of the difficult situation she is in, she decides that that she must make a choice. She chooses to reject the intervention and quits.
5. She decides to leave her current company to work as a waiter to do research on her app. She wants to build a food review app with cultural integrity. One that focuses on the dishes and not the restaurant. Her mission is to shift the purchasing power of food(Is this unclear?).
6. She loses her comfy tech salary, camaraderie of millennials, and healthcare. She progressively works on her app, but the physical needs start to erode her. Furthermore, near the end she realizes that her good intentions were only benefiting herself. She was only focused on making herself feel good that she was helping people. She was too focused on being perceived as a designer that does good.
7. She quits her waiter job and begins contracting...
8. She gets a text from her old boss "Hey, how you doing?". She dismisses the text and sees a new Medium post(by her boss) on Twitter called "starting anew".
